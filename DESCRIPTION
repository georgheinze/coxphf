Description: Implements Firth's penalized maximum likelihood bias reduction method  for Cox regression
  which has been shown to provide a solution in case of monotone likelihood (nonconvergence of likelihood function), see 
  Heinze and Schemper Biometrics (2001) and Heinze and Dunkler StatMed (2008).
  The program fits profile penalized likelihood confidence intervals which were proved to outperform
  Wald confidence intervals.
