}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{a formula object, with the response on the left and the model terms on the right. 
The response must be a survival object as returned by the 'Surv' function (see its documentation in the survival package)}

\item{data}{a data.frame in which to interpret the variables named in the 'formula' argument.}

\item{pl}{specifies if confidence intervals and tests should be based on the profile penalized log likelihood (\code{pl=TRUE}, the default) or on the Wald method (\code{pl=FALSE}).}

\item{alpha}{the significance level (1-\eqn{\alpha} = the confidence level), 0.05 as default.}

\item{maxit}{maximum number of iterations (default value is 50)}

\item{maxhs}{maximum number of step-halvings per iterations (default value is 5). 
The increments of the parameter vector in one Newton-Rhaphson iteration step are halved,
unless the new likelihood is greater than the old one, maximally doing \code{maxhs} halvings.}

\item{epsilon}{specifies the maximum allowed change in standardized parameter estimates to declare convergence. Default value is 1e-6.}

\item{gconv}{specifies the maximum allowed absolute value of first derivative of likelihood to declare convergence. Default value is 0.0001.}

\item{maxstep}{specifies the maximum change of (standardized) parameter values allowed in one iteration. Default value is 0.5.}

\item{firth}{use of Firth's penalized maximum likelihood (\code{firth=TRUE}, default) or the standard maximum likelihood method (\code{firth=FALSE}) for fitting the Cox model.}

\item{adapt}{optional: specifies a vector of 1s and 0s, where 0 means that the corresponding parameter is fixed at 0, while 1 enables parameter estimation for that parameter. The length of adapt must be equal to the number of parameters to be estimated.}

\item{penalty}{strength of Firth-type penalty. Defaults to 0.5.}
}

\description{
Implements Firth's penalized maximum likelihood bias reduction method  for Cox regression which has been 
shown to provide a solution in case of monotone likelihood (nonconvergence of likelihood function).

\details{
The phenomenon of monotone likelihood in a sample causes parameter estimates of a Cox model to diverge, 
with infinite standard errors. Therefore, classical maximum likelihood analysis fails; the usual Wald confidence 
intervals cover the whole range of real numbers. Monotone likelihood appears if there is single covariate 
or a linear combination of covariates such that at each event time, out of all individuals being at risk at that time, 
the individual with the highest (or at each event time the individual with the lowest) value for that covariate 
or linear combination experiences the event. It was shown that analysis by Firth's penalized likelihood method, 
particularly in conjunction with the computation of profile likelihood confidence intervals and penalized 
likelihood ratio tests is superior to maximum likelihood analysis. It completely removes the convergence
 problem mentioned in the paragraph on CONVERGENCE of the description of the function \code{coxph}. 
 The \code{formula} may involve time-dependent effects or time-dependent covariates. The response may be given 
 in counting process style, but it cannot be used for multivariate failure times, as the program has no option 
 to fit a robust covariance matrix. The user is responsible for the independency of observations within each risk set, i.e., 
 the same individual should not appear twice within the same risk set.
 
 The package coxphf provides a comprehensive tool to facilitate the application of Firth's penalized 
 likelihood method to Cox regression analysis. The core routines are written in Fortran 90, (and to our knowledge this is the first package written in Fortran 90). Some description of the problem of monotone likelihood
 and Firth's penalized likelihood method as a solution can be found the web page 
 \url{http://cemsiis.meduniwien.ac.at/en/kb/science-research/software/statistical-software/fccoxphf/}.
 
 Version 1.13  now includes a convergence check and issues a warning in case of non-convergence. Profile likelihood confidence intervals or 
 the estimation of the penalized likelihood ratio $p$-values can be vulnerable
 non-convergence for numerical issues. In case of non-convergence problems, we suggest to first compare the output values iter.ci with the input parameter maxit. 
 Then, set maxstep to a smaller value, e.g., 0.1 and increase the number of allowed iterations to e.g. 500. This setting may slow down convergence for some 
 of the confidence limits, but proved robust also in extreme data sets.
